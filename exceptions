1️⃣ Checked Exception
✅ Definition

A checked exception is an exception that is checked by the compiler at compile time.

👉 The compiler forces you to handle it using:

try-catch or

throws keyword

If you don’t handle it, your code will not compile.

🔹 Examples

IOException

SQLException

FileNotFoundException

ClassNotFoundException

🔹 Example Code
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class CheckedExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            File file = new File("data.txt");
            FileReader reader = new FileReader(file); // Checked Exception
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


❗ If you remove the try-catch, the compiler will show an error.

🔹 When to use checked exceptions?
When the caller can recover from the exception
External resources (file, DB, network)
2️⃣ Unchecked Exception
✅ Definition
An unchecked exception is not checked at compile time.
It occurs at runtime.

👉 The compiler does NOT force you to handle it.

🔹 Examples
NullPointerException,ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
ArithmeticException
IllegalArgumentException

🔹 Example Code
public class UncheckedExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 0;
        int result = a / b; // ArithmeticException
    }
}

This code compiles successfully, but fails at runtime.

🔹 When to use unchecked exceptions?
Programming errors
Invalid logic

Exception occurs in @Transactional method
Question:
Your Spring Boot service calls an external service using RestTemplate / Feign, and the external service is down. How do you handle this?

Answer:
Catch client-specific exceptions (HttpClientErrorException, FeignException)
Translate them into custom business exceptions
Return a meaningful HTTP status to the client
Add timeout + retry (if applicable)

try {
    externalClient.call();
} catch (FeignException.ServiceUnavailable ex) {
    throw new ExternalServiceUnavailableException("Downstream service unavailable");
}

Best practice:
Do NOT expose downstream error details
Use circuit breaker (Resilience4j) for repeated failures
